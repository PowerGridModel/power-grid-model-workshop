    "# Hands-on Workshop: Extending and Modifying a Power Grid Model DS Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction & Setup\n",
    "Power Grid Model DS (PGM-DS) is an open-source Python toolkit for modeling electric power grids. It extends the core power-grid-model engine with a user-friendly interface for data science applications​. In PGM-DS, a power network is represented by a Grid dataclass that manages all network components (nodes, lines, transformers, loads, etc.) and ensures their consistency​.\n",
    "\n",
    "This library provides a graph-based representation of the network and an API to modify the network structure (e.g. adding or removing equipment), which is very useful for simulation studies​. In this workshop, you will perform a series of short exercises to get hands-on experience with two key features of PGM-DS:\n",
    "- Extending a grid with custom properties – how to subclass PGM-DS data structures to add your own fields.\n",
    "- Modifying a grid object – how to build and alter a grid (add nodes, lines, etc.) programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume you are comfortable with Python and Jupyter notebooks. Before we begin, make sure you have PGM-DS installed:\n",

    "pip install power-grid-model-ds[visualizer]\n",

However, certain project-specific data (for example, simulation results or custom labels) are not included out of the box​. PGM-DS allows you to extend the grid data model by subclassing its array classes to add new columns. In other words, you can inherit the existing functionality and add your own fields​.\n",
