# Power Grid Model DS Workshop

Welcome to the **Power Grid Model DS Workshop** â€” an introductory guide to the [Power Grid Model DS](https://github.com/PowerGridModel/power-grid-model-ds) project. This workshop is designed to help you get familiar with the PGM-DS interface and explore its capabilities through hands-on exercises.

## Workshop Structure

The workshop includes two Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Introduction Notebook**  
   A beginner-friendly guide that walks you through the basics of using the Power Grid Model DS interface. Ideal for first-time users.

2. **Advanced Notebook**  
   A more in-depth exploration featuring a grid contingency scenario. You'll apply your knowledge to solve a real-world power grid challenge using PGM-DS.

## How to Load Solutions

Each notebook includes optional solution cells. To reveal a solution, simply run the appropriate `%load` command. For example:
